###Package: validateR

###Title: Psychometric validity and reliability statistics in R

###Type: Package

**Development version**: 0.1.0.

This package will containing anything, and everything, that could possibly fall under the umbrella of quantitative validity or reliability measures. 

At the moment it does:
- Coefficient alpha; KR-20; Spearman-Brown correction; calculates new test length given a desired and present reliablity and test length; standard error of measurement; and standard error of difference.

It is installable at the moment but it's under heavy development and the API has not been finalized. However, if you insist on installing it:

```R
devtools::install_github(repo = "cddesja/validateR")
```
